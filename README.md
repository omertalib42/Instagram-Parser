# Instagram-Parser

The main aim of this project is to parse the direct message data of the Instagram. 

It was just impossible to read it in its original form so I decided to build a proper parser. Let's see how it goes.

02/09/2021 - Update: Looking at the new data, I notice that Json content is changed and improved a lot. I'll continue to develop after checking all differences. 
Current version is designed for old version, parsing the single Messages.json file.
